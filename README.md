# ForemanGraphite

Adds graphite support for [Foreman](http://theforeman.org).

This Foreman plugin allows to use graphite to track performance metrics of your foreman instances.

You will need to install a graphite instance to use this plugin and a Foreman version *higher* than 1.6 (> 1.6)

## Configuration

The graphite host(s) and options can be changed by adding settings to `/usr/share/foreman/config/settings.plugins.d/foreman-graphite.yaml`, or Foreman's own `settings.yaml`.

Example config file:

```yaml
:graphite:
  :server: graphite:2003
    # results are aggregated in n seconds slices, defaults to 60
    :slice: 60
    # send to graphite every n seconds - defaults to 60
    :interval: 60
    # set the max age in seconds for records reanimation, defaults to  4 * 60 * 60
    :cache: 4 * 60 * 60
```
